I did my best to follow the mathematical models presented in the assignment's instruction. It's very detailed, so following the main ideas was time consuming, but straight-forward. In the perceptron, I compared the prediction to the actual value, and if it was not the same, update it so the direction, x, is added to the current vector. The next questions are derivitives of this idea, using squareloss and L2 non-linear regression to predict and mitigate loss. The LanguageIDModel uses a recurrant neural network, i.e. a weight, hidden weight, and final weight using variable dimensions. it enumerates over xs's list items and adds to x and w, then does the same process as the other neural networks. 

I spent over 15 hours on this project, 5 of which was spent just waiting for the neural network to reach a maximum, which took ages. 

All in all, this was a really fun class. I learned a lot and sparked an interest in more complex machine learning algorithms. :)

Thank you for an awesome class.
